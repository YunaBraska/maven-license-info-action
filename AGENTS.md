# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds the TypeScript source for the GitHub Action entry point.
- `lib/` contains compiled JavaScript output from `tsc`.
- `dist/` contains the bundled Action artifact produced by `ncc` for release.
- `test/` holds Jest tests and fixtures.
- `coverage/` is generated by Jest coverage runs.
- `target/` is used for generated license/dependency reports (see README).
- `action.yml` defines inputs/outputs for the Action.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `./clean_node.sh` resets the local Node environment for this repo.
- `npm run build` compiles `src/` to `lib/` and then packages the Action.
- `npm run package` bundles the Action via `ncc` for `dist/`.
- `npm run test` runs the Jest suite with coverage after building.
- `npm run test:coverage` is the explicit coverage run (same as `test`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript, `strict` enabled in `tsconfig.json`.
- Use clear, small functions and descriptive names; match existing patterns in `src/`.
- Keep files organized by feature/concern under `src/`.
- Do not remove `node_modules/` in this repo (Action packaging relies on it).
- Target Node.js 20 for local development (aligns with GitHub Actions runtime).

## Testing Guidelines
- Jest is the test runner (`jest.config.js`).
- Place tests under `test/` and name them to match the behavior under test.
- Run `npm run test` before submitting changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Use Semantic Commit Messages (per `CONTRIBUTING.md`). Example: `chore: new version [2.0.84]`.
- Branch from `main` and keep PRs focused.
- Bump versions following Semantic Versioning when appropriate.
- Ensure changes are covered by tests and adhere to clean code practices.
- Include a clear PR description; link any relevant issues or discussions.

## Architecture Overview
- This is a GitHub Action that inspects Maven dependencies and produces license/dependency reports.
- Primary outputs are generated into `target/maven-license-info-action/` by default.
